## Overview of Project

Clinical Trial Management system is a system that is designed to be useful for pharmaceutical 
organizations working on pharma research ,drug discovery and testing and can be used by big 
team of scientists who research and develop formulae for multiple medicines related to 
different diseases and conditions every year.


#### Objective: 

To digitalise data storage and maintenance process of patients and drug trials
,create dashboard for scientists to manage trial status of the drugs being tested and to keep
track of patient data while facilitate efficient storage , search and retrievals of any required
information.

## Uniqueness

● Simple to use.

● Our project helps in organizing and maintaining data with well designed 
file structures and by eliminating the legacy methods of maintaining data 
in physical files.


● Possessing a clear and accurate picture of clinical trial management 
information provides key strategic advantages and safeguards against 
serious compliance risks.


● Overhead of maintaining all the data in physical files can be eliminated.


● Document processing and Indexing are file structure concepts that we 
are using in this project.


## Project analysis

User (PharmaLab technicians/Doctors) would require Login-Credentials to access the system,


● Login 


● After logging in successfully, Users can navigate through following dashboards


1.Drug Trials dashboard


2.Human subject dashboard


● In drug dashboard, User can add, search, edit and view the drug and its trial information via perform 
fundamental file operations.


● In Human subject dashboard, user can add, search, edit and display the information of the human 
subjects undergoing the trials of a particular drug.

## Conclusion


● This project helps pharmaceutical scientists to maintain the data about 
drugs and human subjects.


● We choose C++ as our language to implement the project, as it is fast 
when dealing with files.

## Future enhancements

➔ Analytics can be created using the trial results of a particular drug.



➔ To create an exe file to run the program on just a single click.



➔ A minimalistic app can be created for volunteers, to update their health 
issues ,dosage information and alert doctors monitoring them
