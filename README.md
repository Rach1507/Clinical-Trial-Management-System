## Overview of Project

Clinical Trial Management system is a system that is designed to be useful for pharmaceutical 
organizations working on pharma research ,drug discovery and testing and can be used by big 
team of scientists who research and develop formulae for multiple medicines related to 
different diseases and conditions every year.


#### Objective: 

To digitalise data storage and maintenance process of patients and drug trials
,create dashboard for scientists to manage trial status of the drugs being tested and to keep
track of patient data while facilitate efficient storage , search and retrievals of any required
information.

## Uniqueness

● Simple to use.

● Our project helps in organizing and maintaining data with well designed 
file structures and by eliminating the legacy methods of maintaining data 
in physical files.


● Possessing a clear and accurate picture of clinical trial management 
information provides key strategic advantages and safeguards against 
serious compliance risks.


● Overhead of maintaining all the data in physical files can be eliminated.


● Document processing and Indexing are file structure concepts that we 
are using in this project.
